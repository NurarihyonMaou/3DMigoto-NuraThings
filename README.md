# 3DMigoto-NuraThings
<b>Dependencies used in my Mods</b>

If You've never used any of my Mods requiring those Dependecies:
- Make a New Folder inside Mods\BufferValues, name it NuraThings and Extract the Folders into it (Open the Zip and first Folder within it)

If You have a 'NuraThings' Folder inside Mods Folder already:
- Open the Zip and the Folder within and Extract the Folders into Mods\BufferValues\NuraThings
